## Dependencies

A "requirements.txt" file is provided to install any dependencies needed to run the code.

The code is organized as per the assignment questions:

## Q1
"decoder_WW.py" contains the code to decode the image labels from W, T matrices.
The output is displayed as the standard output

## Q2
"TrainCRF_GG.py" contains the code to compute the gradiets and log posterior probabilities

## Q3
The code and all the necessary files are contained in folder "q3". The folder has a separate README file that can be read to understand the directory structure. "plottingq3.py" is used to create the plots.

## Q4
Similar to Q3, the code and necessary files are contained in folder "q4". It also contains a separate README file and "plottingq4.py" was used to create the plots.
