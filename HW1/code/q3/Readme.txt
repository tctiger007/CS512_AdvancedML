
How to execute:

plots are provided q3\

SVM_HMM
q3\svmhmm\svm_hmm_classify.exe svm_hmm_learn.exe for learning from train_struct and test_struct.txt

q3\svmhmm\letteraccuracies.py  for getting letter accuracies

p_labels/msl have different labels/models generated for differnt c values (1,10,100,1000,5000) 


SVM_MC
required liblinear lib which is in the location provided for comfort

q4\data\SVM_MC_liblinear-2.30\python\svmmc.py for letter and word accuracies 

its uses data train.txt, traintransformed.txt and test.txt 
has some intermediate files dftrain.txt for data conversions
